# Image Assets Directory

This directory should contain:

1. **profile.png** - ✅ Professional headshot of Dr. Mujeeb ur Rehman Jamali (ADDED!)
   - Recommended size: 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio)
   - High quality, professional lighting
   - Formal or business casual attire

2. **favicon.ico** - Website favicon
   - 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixel versions
   - Should represent the professional brand

## Image Guidelines:

### Profile Photo:
- Use a high-resolution image (at least 800x800px)
- Professional appearance with good lighting
- Neutral or academic background
- Square crop for best results in circular frame

### Optimization:
- Compress images for web use
- Use appropriate formats (JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics)
- Consider WebP format for better compression

## Placeholder Image:
Until the actual profile photo is provided, the website will show a placeholder.
You can replace the src attribute in index.html with the actual image path once uploaded.

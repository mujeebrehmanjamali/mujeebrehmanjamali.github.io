# Contact Form FIXED - Root Cause Analysis & Solution

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

### **The Problem in contact-form.js:**
1. ❌ **JavaScript was intercepting form submission** with `e.preventDefault()`

### **Why You Weren't Receiving Emails:**

## 🎯 **WHAT CHANGED**

```

```html
<!-- Simple HTML form that actually works -->
<form action="https://formsubmit.co/mujeeb.jamali@gcuh.edu.pk" method="POST">
    <!-- Form fields -->
    <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="success-page">
</form>
```
